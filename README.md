# ThroneofInfluence: A Strategy Board Game
Throne of Influence is a two-player strategy game where players compete to control a central "throne" node by moving a piece with sufficient weight to it. The game is played on a hexagonal board with interconnected nodes, each with a resource value. Players maneuver pieces, collect resources, upgrade their piecesâ€™ weights, and engage in tactical combat where adjacent pieces support each other.

# Game Rules
Each player starts with 5 pieces on their side of the board.

On each turn, a player can move one piece to an adjacent node.

If the node is occupied by an opponent's piece, a capture attempt occurs based on the total weight of supporting pieces.

After moving, the player collects resources from all nodes they occupy.

Resources can be spent to upgrade pieces or recruit new ones.

The game ends when a player moves a piece with weight 5 or higher to the central node.
