# ThroneofInfluence: A Strategy Board Game
Throne of Influence is a two-player strategy game where players compete to control a central "throne" node by moving a piece with sufficient weight to it. The game is played on a hexagonal board with interconnected nodes, each with a resource value. Players maneuver pieces, collect resources, upgrade their piecesâ€™ weights, and engage in tactical combat where adjacent pieces support each other.
