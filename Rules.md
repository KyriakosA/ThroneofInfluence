# RULES.md - Throne of Influence
Throne of Influence is a strategic two-player board game where players compete to control the central "throne" node by moving a piece with sufficient weight to it. The game takes place on a hexagonal grid, where players move pieces, collect resources, upgrade their forces, and engage in combat to secure victory.

# Setup
Board: The game is played on a hexagonal grid consisting of 19 nodes:
1 central node (the "throne").

6 middle ring nodes surrounding the throne.

12 outer ring nodes forming the perimeter.

Pieces: Each player begins with 5 pieces, each with an initial weight of 1.
Player 1 places their 5 pieces on the 5 outer nodes closest to their side of the board.

Player 2 places their 5 pieces on the 5 outer nodes closest to their opposite side.

Resources: Both players start with 0 resources in their resource pool.

# Objective
The goal is to be the first player to move a piece with a weight of 5 or higher onto the central node, immediately winning the game.
# Game Components
Nodes: Each node provides resources when occupied:
Outer nodes: 1 resource per turn.

Middle nodes: 2 resources per turn.

Central node: 3 resources per turn.

Pieces: Each piece has a weight, starting at 1, which can be increased by spending resources.

Resources: Collected from nodes occupied by your pieces at the end of your turn, used to upgrade pieces or recruit new ones.

# Turn Sequence
Each player’s turn follows three steps:
Move: Move one of your pieces to an adjacent node.

Collect Resources: Gain resources from all nodes you currently occupy.

Spend Resources (Optional): Use collected resources to upgrade existing pieces or recruit new ones.

# Movement
Move One Piece: Select one of your pieces and move it to an adjacent node connected by an edge.

Empty Node: If the destination node is unoccupied, your piece takes control of it.

Occupied Node: If the destination node is occupied by an opponent’s piece, a capture attempt occurs (see Combat and Capture (#combat-and-capture)).

# Combat and Capture
Combat occurs when you move a piece onto a node occupied by an opponent’s piece:
Attacker’s Total Weight: The weight of your moving piece plus the weights of all your pieces on adjacent nodes.

Defender’s Total Weight: The weight of the defending piece plus the weights of all the opponent’s pieces on adjacent nodes.

Resolution:
If the attacker’s total weight exceeds the defender’s, the defender’s piece is removed, and the attacker’s piece occupies the node.

If the attacker’s total weight is equal to or less than the defender’s, the capture fails, and the attacker’s piece returns to its original node.

This mechanic rewards clustering pieces for mutual support in combat.
Resource Collection
After moving, collect resources from every node you occupy:
Outer nodes provide 1 resource.

Middle nodes provide 2 resources.

The central node provides 3 resources.

Resources are added to your pool and can be spent immediately or saved for later turns.

Spending Resources
After collecting resources, you may spend them on the following:
Upgrade a Piece: Increase the weight of one piece by 1 for 3 resources.
Example: Upgrading from weight 1 to 2 costs 3 resources; from 2 to 3 costs another 3 resources, etc.

Recruit a New Piece: Place a new piece with weight 1 on an empty node in your starting outer row for 5 resources.

You may perform multiple actions (e.g., upgrading and recruiting) in one turn if you have sufficient resources.
Victory Condition
The game ends as soon as a player moves a piece with a weight of 5 or higher onto the central node. That player wins instantly.
Additional Rules
Movement Restrictions: Pieces cannot pass through occupied nodes; they must stop or attempt a capture.

Node Occupation: Only one piece can occupy a node at a time.

Resource Spending: Resources can only be spent during your turn, after collection.

Weight Limit: The maximum weight for any piece is 5.
